    nuttcp is a network performance measurement tool intended for use by
    network and system managers. Its most basic usage is to determine the raw
    TCP (or UDP) network layer throughput by transferring memory buffers from a
    source system across an interconnecting network to a destination system,
    either trans ferring data for a specified time interval, or alternatively
    transferring a specified number of bytes. In addition to reporting the
    achieved network throughput in Mbps, nuttcp also provides additional useful
    information related to the data transfer such as user, system, and
    wall-clock time, transmitter and rec eiver CPU utilization, and loss
    percentage (for UDP transfers).
